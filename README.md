# CMPE255
This is for project of CMPE 255
Here we are building a machine learning model to identify the flower type in an image dataset. (weâ€™re limiting flowers to 100 types, so that it would be simpler). 
We are using TPUs to do flower classification on a dataset including more than 100 types of flowers. 
The dataset is small and comes from many disparate sources, so there are plenty of opportunities to learn about data cleaning and image augmentation as well.

We implemented three models: ResNet, DenseNet, EfficientNet
